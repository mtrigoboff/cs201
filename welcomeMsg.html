<p>In this course we'll be learning about the object code that the C compiler produces based on your source code. In the process, you will learn about the &quot;official&quot; nature of the machine and what your C code has actually been asking that machine to do. Later in the course, you will find out that the <em>actual</em> machine is very different from the &quot;official version&quot; described in the IA-32 Architecture Manuals.</p>
<p>Then we'll be learning about some unusual situations in which
  functions can return twice, return to someplace other than where they
  were called, or not return at all.  After that, we'll cover how to optimize your code for maximum
  performance, issues related to memory use, and the true (and
surprising!) nature of what actually happens inside an advanced Intel-compatible computer.</p>
