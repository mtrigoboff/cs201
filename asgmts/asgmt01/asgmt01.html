<p><i>Remember that you only need to do one of these, either the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Regular.lbi" --> <strong>Regular</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem --> or the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Premium.lbi" --> <strong>Premium</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem --> version.</i> </p>
<hr />
<h3><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Regular.lbi" --> <strong>Regular</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem --> Version</h3>
<p>First, your program should print out either &ldquo;byte order: big-endian&rdquo; or &ldquo;byte order: little-endian&rdquo; depending on the characteristics of the machine your code is running on. Your program should figure this out at <em>run time</em>, not at <em>compile time</em>. </p>
<p>Then, using <span class="code">scanf</span> and <span class="code">printf</span>, write a program that requests numbers from the user
  and then prints each number out in a variety of formats.</p>
<p>For each number typed in, your program should print out two lines: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>first line</i>
      <ul>
        <li>integer, right justified in a 10 character field</li>
        <li>hex representation of the integer (the 4-byte actual value that is independent of the machine&rsquo;s endian-ness)</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>second line</i>
      <ul>
        <li>floating, right justified in a 10 character field, with 2 digits to the right of the decimal point</li>
        <li>hex representation of the floating number (the 4-byte actual value that is independent of the machine&rsquo;s endian-ness). <em>Do not</em> use C99&rsquo;s %a or %A format specifier for this. You are required to use the %X format specifier.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Your program should repeatedly ask for input until the user types in a zero, and then it should exit. Each number in the input will be an integer, expressed as a decimal number. Some of the numbers will be negative, expressed like this: &minus;3. You do not need to worry about bad input. I will run your code with a script that does not do this. </p>
<p>Your program&rsquo;s output should be formatted <span style="font-style: italic">exactly</span> as shown in <span class="code">asgmt01.output.txt</span> (including uppercase vs. lowercase). I use scripts to grade assignments, and if your output is formatted &ldquo;creatively&rdquo; (i.e. different from what&rsquo;s requested), you will lose points for that. </p>
<p>If you run <span class="code">a01</span>,
  you will be able to observe the desired behavior directly.
This file was built in Linux, and will run in Linux.</p>
<p>Start with file <strong class="code">a01.c</strong>, contained in the provided zip file.</p>
<p>Upload your work as <span class="code"><strong>a01.c</strong></span>. </p>

<h3><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Premium.lbi" --> <strong>Premium</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem -->  Version</h3>
<p>First, your program should print out either &ldquo;byte order: big-endian&rdquo; or &ldquo;byte order: little-endian&rdquo; depending on the characteristics of the machine your code is running on. Your program should figure this out at <em>run time</em>, not at <em>compile time</em>. </p>
<p>Then your code should accept user input in the form of 8 hexadecimal digits. Your code will interpret those 8 digits as an <a href="http://steve.hollasch.net/cgindex/coding/ieeefloat.html" target="_blank"><u>IEEE 754</u></a> 32-bit floating point number and will print out information about that number. Do not worry about bad input. My test script does not do this.</p>
<p>Use <strong>scanf</strong> to get the user input. Your code should accept input with or without &quot;0x&quot; in front of it (scanf does this). </p>
<p>For each number, your code should print out:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the sign bit</li>
  <li>the exponent bits, expressed as a decimal number</li>
  <li>the fraction bits, expressed as an 8 digit hexadecimal number </li>
</ul>
<p>Here is what your code should print out for the various types of floating point number: </p>
<ul>
  <li>normalized
    <ul>
        <li>the word<span class="style1"> &quot;normalized&quot;</span> and the true exponent (i.e. the power to which 2 will be raised in computing the numerical value of the floating point number) </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>denormalized
    <ul>
        <li>the word<span class="style1"> &quot;denormalized&quot;</span> and the true exponent</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>infinity
    <ul>
        <li><span class="style1">&quot;+infinity</span>&quot; or<span class="style1"> &quot;-infinity&quot;</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>zero
    <ul>
        <li><span class="style1">&quot;+zero</span>&quot; or<span class="style1"> &quot;-zero&quot;</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>NaN
    <ul>
        <li><span class="style1">&quot;SNaN&quot;</span> or<span class="style1"> &quot;QNan&quot;</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Your program&rsquo;s output should be formatted <span style="font-style: italic">exactly</span> as shown in <span class="code">asgmt01p.output.txt</span>  (including uppercase vs. lowercase). I use scripts to grade assignments, and if your output is formatted &ldquo;creatively&rdquo; (i.e. different from what&rsquo;s requested), you will lose points for that. </p>
<p>Your program should exit when user input that results in a zero value is entered, after printing the information for that zero input.</p>
<p>If you run <span class="code">a01p</span>, you will be able to observe the desired behavior directly. This file was built in Linux, and will run in Linux.</p>
<p>Start with file <strong class="code">a01p.c</strong>, contained in the provided zip file.</p>
<p>Upload your work as <span class="code"><strong>a01p.c</strong></span>. </p>

<p class="header">Required Platform</p>
<p>I grade your code on<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/class Linux machine.lbi" --> <strong>syccuxfs01.pcc.edu</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem -->. Your code is required to compile and run correctly on that  machine.</p>
<p class="header">Compiling Your Code</p>
<p>You are required to use these flags when compiling your code:</p>
<blockquote>
<table width="571" border="0">
  <caption>
    Required gcc Compiler Flags
  </caption>
  <tr>
    <th width="103"><em>flag</em></th>
    <th width="411"><em>effect of specifying flag</em></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-<span class="code">m32</span></td>
    <td>compiles 32-bit code, disallows use of 64-bit integer registers</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="code">-std=gnu11</td>
    <td>allows use of newer features of C</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="code">-Wall</td>
    <td>compiler produces all possible warnings</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="code">-g</td>
    <td>includes information needed by debugger in object code</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is how you would use these flags:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="code">gcc -m32 -std=gnu11 -Wall -g yourcode.c -o yourcode</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="header">Grading Your Code</p>
<p>Your code needs to compile without errors or warnings and run correctly. Code that does not compile will receive zero points. Code that crashes will receive zero points.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)" target="_blank">bash</a> scripts to grade your code. Because of this, it is very important that you submit your code <em>with the file name that was requested</em>. If you change the file name, my scripts will crash, your work will not be graded, you will have to resubmit a corrected version of your work, and you will lose points.</p>
<p>My scripts produce a log file containing your code, compiler warnings and errors (if any), your code's output, and some statistics that are useful to me. I then personally go through that log file to produce your grade. In other words, the scripts don't generate your grade, they just make it more convenient for <em>me</em> to generate your grade.</p>
<p class="header">To Submit This Assignment</p>
<p>Submit the requested file to Desire2Learn. &nbsp; Make sure that your code prints your name, assignment description, and number, as requested. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Be  certain to check that you completed the upload successfully. After you click  the Upload File button, you must also click the <strong>SUBMIT ASSIGNMENT </strong>button. This  is very easy to forget. If you do not do this, I will not see your work and you will get a grade of zero for the assignment. I would recommend entering an  email address so you can be notified that the upload was completed  successfully.</li>
  <li>You  may upload as many versions as you wish prior to the due date. I will only see  and grade the final one. You will not be able to upload assignments after due date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Points will be deducted for uploading a file with a name that is not as specified. Every term I get a few students whose approach to following directions is, shall we say, &ldquo;creative.&rdquo; I encourage creativity in general, but there are places where it is <u>not appropriate</u>.</p>
