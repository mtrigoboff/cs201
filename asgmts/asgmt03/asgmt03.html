<p class="title">CS201 Assignment 3 Instructions</p>
<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="description" -->
<p>Write code that forks into two processes, a <b>parent process</b>, and
  a <b>child process</b>.</p>
<p>The <b>parent process</b> will take the arguments to<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"> main()</font> and send the characters in them <i>one at a time</i> to the child process through a <b>pipe</b> (one call to <b>write</b> for each character).</p>
<p>Do not send characters from<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" class="code"> argv[0]</font> through the pipe.  Start with<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"> argv[1]</font> and
  continue through the rest of the arguments.</p>
<p>The <b>child process</b> will read the characters sent by the parent process <span style="font-style: italic">one at a time</span>, and count the number of characters it received from the parent. The child process <span style="font-style: italic">should not</span> use the arguments to<span class="code"> main()</span> <span style="font-style: italic">in any way whatsoever</span>. The child process will communicate the number of characters counted to the parent as the return value from<span class="code"> main()</span>.</p>
<p>The parent process will need to reap the child process to find out how many characters were counted by the child process.</p>
<p>It may be of use to know that<font face="Courier"> read()</font> will return immediately
  with a zero once the other end of the pipe is closed by the parent.</p>
<p>If I call your code this way: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">a03 abcd efg hi</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The parent process should print out:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">CS201 - Assignment 3 - I. Forgot
child counted 9 characte</font>rs</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Important: printing should be done only by the parent process. The child process should not print anything. </em></p>
<p>Your output should be formatted exactly as shown (small differences in whitespace are OK). Remember to replace &ldquo;I. Forgot&rdquo; with your own name.</p>
<p>Start with the provided code  file <strong>a03.c</strong>. Upload your code as <strong>a03.c</strong>. </p>
<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
<p class="header">Required Platform</p>
<p>I grade your code on  <strong>syccuxfs01.pcc.edu</strong>. Your code is required to compile and run correctly on that  machine.</p>
<p class="header">Compiling Your Code</p>
<p>You are required to use these flags when compiling your code:</p>
<blockquote>
<table width="571" border="0">
  <caption>
    Required gcc Compiler Flags
  </caption>
  <tr>
    <th width="103"><em>flag</em></th>
    <th width="411"><em>effect of specifying flag</em></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-<span class="code">m32</span></td>
    <td>compiles 32-bit code, disallows use of 64-bit integer registers</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="code">-std=gnu99</td>
    <td>allows use of newer features of C</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="code">-Wall</td>
    <td>compiler produces all possible warnings</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="code">-g</td>
    <td>includes information needed by debugger in object code</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is how you would use these flags:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="code">gcc -m32 -std=gnu99 -Wall -g yourcode.c -o yourcode</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="header">Grading Your Code</p>
<p>Your code needs to compile without errors or warnings and run correctly. Code that does not compile will receive zero points. Code that crashes will receive zero points.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)" target="_blank">bash</a> scripts to grade your code. Because of this, it is very important that you submit your code <em>with the file name that was requested</em>. If you change the file name, my scripts will crash, your work will not be graded, you will have to resubmit a corrected version of your work, and you will lose points.</p>
<p>My scripts produce a log file containing your code, compiler warnings and errors (if any), your code's output, and some statistics that are useful to me. I then personally go through that log file to produce your grade. In other words, the scripts don't generate your grade, they just make it more convenient for <em>me</em> to generate your grade.</p>
<p class="header">To Submit This Assignment</p>
<p>Submit the requested file to Desire2Learn. &nbsp; Make sure that your code prints your name, assignment description, and number, as requested. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Be  certain to check that you completed the upload successfully. After you click  the Upload File button, you must also click the <strong>SUBMIT ASSIGNMENT </strong>button. This  is very easy to forget. If you do not do this, I will not see your work and you will get a grade of zero for the assignment. I would recommend entering an  email address so you can be notified that the upload was completed  successfully.</li>
  <li>You  may upload as many versions as you wish prior to the due date. I will only see  and grade the final one. You will not be able to upload assignments after due date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Points will be deducted for uploading a file with a name that is not as specified. Every term I get a few students whose approach to following directions is, shall we say, &ldquo;creative.&rdquo; I encourage creativity in general, but there are places where it is <u>not appropriate</u>.</p>
