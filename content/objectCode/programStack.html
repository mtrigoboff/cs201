<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="content" -->
<p>The program stack (also known as &ldquo;the stack&rdquo; or &ldquo;the calling stack&rdquo; is the place where memory for C function arguments and local variables is allocated.  (These are the so-called &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; variables.)</p>
<p>The program stack is supported by the following features of the IA-32 architecture:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>registers
		</em><br />
		<br />
		<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
			<tr valign="top">
				<th width="74" scope="col"><div align="left">register</div></th>
				<th scope="col"><div align="left">comment</div></th>
			</tr>
			<tr valign="top">
				<td class="codeInText"><div align="left" class="codeInText">esp</div></td>
				<td><div align="left">stack pointer: points to &ldquo;top&rdquo; of stack (which is the <em>lowest</em> address because the stack grows <em>downwards)</em></div></td>
			</tr>
			<tr valign="top">
				<td class="codeInText"><div align="left" class="codeInText">ebp</div></td>
				<td><div align="left">frame pointer: points to where caller&rsquo;s frame pointer is stored. Positive offsets from ebp point to function arguments (starting with ebp&nbsp;+&nbsp;8). Negative offsets from ebp point to local variables. </div></td>
			</tr>

				<td class="codeInText"><div align="left" class="codeInText">eax</div></td>
				<td><div align="left">integer and pointer return values are returned from functions in eax. Floating point values are returned in another way, which will be discussed later in this course. </div></td>
			</tr>

				<td class="codeInText">leave</td>

<p class="headerText">Code That Demonstrates The Program Stack</p>
<p>Run the following code samples in<strong> gdb</strong>, and watch what happens on the stack.</p>
<p>To see the stack, open a Memory window, and set its Address parameter to: $esp. You will then be able to watch values being pushed onto and popped off of the stack. </p>
<p>You should set the Memory window to display 4-byte values. If the window is not doing this, open the window&rsquo;s Preferences (by using the window&rsquo;s Addresses menu). Set the window&rsquo;s Size property to Word. </p>
<p><strong>stack.c</strong> demonstrates the behavior of the stack when a function is called, and how the local variables for that function are allocated and used. Note that local variables <em>are not</em> initialized. Doing so would add too much overhead to the function-calling process. </p>
<p><strong>stackr.c</strong> demonstrates how a recursive function uses the stack.</p>
<p><strong>stackmain.c</strong> demonstrates how the arguments to <span class="codeInText">main()</span> are stored. It turns out they are stored on the stack in exactly the same way as the arguments to any other function. The only thing special about <span class="codeInText">main()</span> is that the operating system calls it when it wants to run your program. </p>
<p><strong>stackretup2.c</strong> and <strong>stackretupn.c</strong> demonstrate how a function can return higher up the stack than the function that called it.</p>
<p><strong>jump.c</strong> also demonstrates how a function can &ldquo;jump&rdquo; up the stack  higher than the function that called it.</p>
<p class="headerText">Buffer Overflow Attacks </p>
<p>Vulnerability to buffer overflows is a significant software weakness that is often exploited by attackers. The vulnerability occurs when a buffer is allocated <em>on the stack</em>, and the buffer is not protected from &ldquo;overflow&rdquo;  (i.e. writing past the end of the buffer).</p>
<p>Figures 3.17 and 3.28 in <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/textbook authors.lbi" --> <a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Bryant&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;Hallaron</a><!-- #EndLibraryItem --> illustrate the structure of a stack frame. Note that the current function&rsquo;s <em>return address</em> is stored   &ldquo;above&rdquo; (i.e. at a higher address than) all local variables. This means that if you write far enough past a buffer allocated as a local variable, <em>you can clobber the return address</em>. You can make the function  &ldquo;return&rdquo; anywhere you want it to. This is the essence of a buffer overflow attack. </p>
<p>An example of this sort of attack would be a network packet that&rsquo;s longer than it should be, targeting a buffer on the stack that is not protected from overflows. </p>
<p><strong>bofproc.c</strong> simulates a buffer overflow attack that transfers control to a privileged operating system function. You can step through this code in <strong> gdb </strong> and watch the attack happen and succeed. </p>
<p><strong>bofstk.c</strong> simulates a buffer overflow attack that transfers control to code within the buffer that overflowed (as might happen if a rogue packet is received that contains its own attack code. You can watch this happen in <strong> gdb</strong>.</p>
<p>The attack code instructions being placed in the buffer include the one-byte instruction, 0x90. This is the NOP instruction, which does nothing (it stands for &ldquo;no operation&rdquo;), and moves on to the next instruction. It can be used in attacks like this when you&rsquo;re not exactly sure where your code will start executing. In this situation, you can start your code with a string of NOP instructions, which will &ldquo;capture&rdquo; the flow of control and lead it into your attack code.</p>
<p><em>By the way, you are being taught about this so that you can defend yourself from attacks. If I ever hear that one of my students has used these techniques for evil, I will personally come and testify against that student at their trial, <u>even if I have to spend my own money to get there</u>.</em></p>
<p>Step through function <span class="codeInText">bofstk</span> until the last line of code (the one that sets <span class="codeInText">buffer[7]</span>). Now switch the Source Window to MIXED mode and continue stepping (using either the <span class="codeInText">si</span> command in the Console Window, or typing S to the Source Window). Once function <span class="codeInText">bofstk</span> &ldquo;returns&rdquo; to an address within its own buffer (by executing a <span class="codeInText">ret</span> instruction), you will not be able to watch the program run in <strong> gdb</strong>&rsquo;s Source Window. But you can continue to step the code (and watch the <span class="codeInText">eip</span> register increment). If you do this a few times, you will see value <span class="codeInText">0xdeadbeef</span> appear in register <span class="codeInText">eax</span>, proving that the attack succeeded. </p>
<p class="headerText">Visual Studio </p>
<p>You can run <a href="files/stack.zip">a version of the code</a> from this lesson in Visual Studio, where you will see that things are similar but not quite the same as they are in Linux. To get a Memory window in the Visual Studio debugger, go to Debug&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Memory and choose one of Memory&nbsp;1 through Memory&nbsp;4.</p>
<p>Once you have the window, type <span class="codeInText">esp</span> into its Address field, and then click the double-arrow icon to the right of the field so that a box is displayed around it. The window will then show you the stack. If the window is not showing you 32-bit values, right-click in the window and select &ldquo;4-byte Integer.&rdquo; </p>
<p>To step through the object code, right-click in the C source code and choose &ldquo;Go To Disassembly.&rdquo; </p>
