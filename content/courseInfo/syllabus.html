   	<p class="headerText">Instructor &ndash; Michael Trigoboff </p>
	<p>My office is on the <a href="http://www.pcc.edu/pcc/dma/sylvaniamap.htm" target="_blank">Sylvania Campus</a> in TCB 312. If you need office time with me you should communicate with me about when we can do that.</p>
	<p>If you need  to communicate with me privately, you should use the email feature of this Desire2Learn site.</p>
	<p><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/distance students welcome.lbi" -->
This course is often taught as parallel sections, one in the classroom and the other  via distance learning. When that is the case, distance students who want to attend classroom sessions are always welcome.<!-- #EndLibraryItem --></p>
  <p>If you&rsquo;re interested, you can find out more about me at <a href="http://spot.pcc.edu/~mtrigobo" target="_blank">http://spot.pcc.edu/~mtrigobo</a>.</p>
	<p class="headerText">Course Description </p>
	<p>This course will introduce you to what&rsquo;s &ldquo;beneath the surface&rdquo; of higher-level programming languages like C and C++, namely the &ldquo;object code.&rdquo; You will learn things about object code that will make you a more capable programmer. There&rsquo;s no substitute for knowing what&rsquo;s really going on &ldquo;under the hood,&rdquo; and this course will teach you about that.</p>
	<p>In this course, we will mainly be working with Unix. Unix skills are valuable and acquiring them should increase your employment opportunities. If a job interviewer asks you to demonstrate some Unix skills, you don&rsquo;t want to be sitting in front of that workstation wondering, &ldquo;What do I do now?&rdquo; </p>
	<p>Unix is available to you in the following ways: </p>
  <ul>
		<li>Windows PC
			<ul>
				<li>the department&rsquo;s Linux machine, <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/syccuxfs01.lbi" --> <strong>syccuxfs01.pcc.edu</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem -->. You will be required to use this machine for Assignment 4. </li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
              <li>download <a href="http://cygwin.com" target="_blank">Cygwin</a> (a Windows-based Linux emulator) and install it on your PC. Cygwin is also available on the lab machines in the Sylvania campus <a href="http://www.pcc.edu/services/index.cfm/162,html" target="_blank">Computer Resource Center</a>.</li>
              <li>download <a href="http://www.linux.org" target="_blank">Linux</a> and install it on a PC you own. You can either make Linux the only operating system on your machine, or create a dual-boot setup so that you can run either in Linux or in Windows on the same machine.</li>
            </ul>
		</li>
       	<li>Macintosh
       		<ul>
       			<li>modern Macs are Unix machines. Just open a command line window and you&rsquo;re talking to Unix.</li>
           	    <li>you will, however, not be able to use Mac Unix for this course unless you have an Intel-based Mac. This course concentrates on the Intel IA-32 architecture.  </li>
       		</ul>
       	</li>
   	</ul>
	<p>You will be using the <b>C</b> programming language in this course. All of the programming assignments should be done in C within a Unix environment.</p>
<p>In addition to acquiring skill with Unix, you should also develop proficiency with one of the source code text editors that are common in Unix. Your choices are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>vi</strong>
			<ul>
			  <li>the power you need for programming</li>
		  </ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>emacs</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>much more power than you need, has a steeper learning curve than <strong>vi</strong> (emacs is actually the programming language Lisp masquerading as a text editor) </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
  <p>I use <strong>vi</strong>, but you are free to choose <strong>emacs</strong> if you want something much more powerful. If you&rsquo;re at that job interview and they find out that you can't do text editing in Unix, they will <em>not</em> be impressed. </p>
	<p class="headerText">Learning Outcomes </p>
	<p>In t his course, you will you learn about the following topics: </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>how to do programming using  Unix and the C language</li>
	  <li>what&rsquo;s &ldquo;under the surface&rdquo; of your C/C++ code
        <ul>
          <li>object code (assembly code, machine language) </li>
          <li>the machine itself (which will be studied more extensively in CS201)</li>
          <li>what the machine is actually doing when it executes your code</li>
        </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>deeper knowledge of how your programs work</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>special features of the Unix operating system</li>
	    <li>performance optimization</li>
	    <li>understanding of the true nature of the underlying Intel IA-32 architecture </li>
      </ul>
	  <li>Intel&rsquo;s IA-32 Architecture
	    <ul>
	      <li>the Intel Assembly Language instructions commonly seen in object code</li>
          <li>the machinery underlying the Intel IA-32 architecture
            <ul>
              <li>for instance, registers like <strong>eax</strong> are merely a convenient fiction </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>the structure and function of &ldquo;the stack&rdquo;
        (also known as &ldquo;the calling stack&rdquo;) 
        <ul>
          <li>detailed understanding of &ldquo;function calling overhead&rdquo; </li>
          <li>understanding of the nature of &ldquo;buffer overflow attacks&rdquo;</li>
        </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>exceptional control flow
	    <ul>
          <li>functions that return twice, functions that never return, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
	  <li>techniques for optimizing your code to make it run faster </li>
	  <li>opportunity to practice and improve your programming skills</li>
  </ul>
	<p class="headerText">Textbooks </p>
	<p>The textbook for this course is <a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu" target="_blank">Computer Systems: A Programmer&rsquo;s Perspective, Second Edition</a>, by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O&rsquo;Hallaron. It is available at the <a href="http://www.pcc.edu/resources/bookstore/" target="_blank">PCC bookstore</a>.</p>

	</blockquote>
	<p>You can get a used copy of the <a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/public/1e/home.html" target="_blank">first edition</a> instead, and save yourself some money.</p>

  </blockquote>
	<p>Make sure to go to the textbook site&rsquo;s errata page (<a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/public/errata.html" target="_blank">second edition</a>, <a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/public/1e/public/errata.html" target="_blank">first edition</a>). You will save yourself <em>hours</em> of futile effort attempting to understand incorrect (and therefore incomprehensible) material. The 1st edition, in particular has a large number of errata, a number of which were contributed by me (including <a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/public/1e/public/byteasm.html" target="_blank">this one</a>, which got me my very own page on their site). </p>
	<p>If you need a reference to the C programming language, there are many available online. The <a href="../../GNU C Programming Tutorial.pdf" target="_blank">GNU C Tutorial</a>, for instance  is usable, but occasionally it expresses strong opinions that I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree with (e.g. regarding the <span class="codeInText">goto</span> statement).</p>
	<p>If you want a book, <a href="http://vig.prenhall.com/catalog/academic/product/0,4096,0131103628,00.html" target="_blank"> The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition</a> by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie is a classic of Computer Science. Kernighan and Ritchie are the creators of C. </p>

	<p class="headerText">Course Work </p>
	<p>The work for this course will consist of <b>online quizzes </b>and <b>programming assignments</b>. The quizzes are available in the &ldquo;Assessments&rdquo; section of the course home page. The assignments are available in the &ldquo;Assignments&rdquo; section of the course home page. The assignments will sometimes (but not always) consist of a <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Regular.lbi" --> <strong>Regular</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem --> part and a <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Premium.lbi" --> <strong>Premium</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem --> part.</p>
	<p class="headerText">How To Submit Programming Assignments </p>
	<p class="headerText2">Personalize Your Code</p>
	<p>Your code should always print out the following as its first line of output:</p>
	<blockquote>
      <p>CS201 - <strong>assignment - your name</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
	<p>Make sure you change the places marked in <strong>bold text</strong> to show me which assignment you are submitting and who you are. <br />
        <br />
	  For example, if I were submitting assignment 3, my code would print out: </p>
	<blockquote>
      <p>CS201 - A03 - Michael Trigoboff</p>
  </blockquote>
	<p><em>I will deduct IQ points if you submit an assignment to me and your code prints out &ldquo;assignment&rdquo; or &ldquo;your name</em>.<em>&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:-) </p>
	<p class="headerText2">What To Upload</p>
	<p>Each individual assignment will specify what you have to upload.</p>
	<p>Do not get &ldquo;creative&rdquo; with the file names. Name your files <em>exactly</em> as specified (this includes whether letters in the name are upper-case or lower-case). I use scripts to compile and run your code, and when your file names are not what&rsquo;s expected, my scripts don&rsquo;t work. Annoying your instructor in this way will most likely not produce the benevolent and merciful attitude that you hope for...</p>
	<p class="headerText">Grading</p>
	<p>Your grade for this course will be a function of your grades on the quizzes and programming assignments.  </p>
	<p><span class="headerText2">Grading For Quizzes</span></p>
	<p>You are allowed to take each quiz <em>twice </em>(it will be exactly the same quiz each time you take it). Your grade for a quiz will be the <em>average</em> of your scores for the two attempts. This means that if you get a perfect score the first time you take a quiz, <em>there is no reason to take it the second time</em>.</p>
	<p><span class="headerText2">Grading For Assignments</span></p>
	<p>You will get a maximum of either <strong>100</strong> or <strong>200</strong> points for each assignment. To get a good grade, you will want to maximize the number of these points that you earn.	</p>
	<p class="headerText3"><span>How To Get 100 For An Assignment</span></p>
	<p>To get <b>100 </b>for an assignment, you must do the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Regular.lbi" --> <strong>Regular</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem --> part of the assignment in a satisfactory manner, which means your work must: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>be coded according to the <a href="codingStds.html">Coding Standards</a></li>
       	<li>compile without warnings (using gcc&rsquo;s<span class="codeInText"> -Wall </span>flag) </li>
       	<li>run without errors when given correct input and arguments. You do not need to check for input or argument errors unless:
       		<ul>
       			<li>such checking is specified by an assignment</li>
               	<li>you feel like doing it for your own learning </li>
           	</ul>
       	</li>
       	<li>produce output <em>exactly as specified</em> by the assignment (I run your code using scripts, and non-standard output causes problems in that environment) </li>
   	    <li>be submitted on time</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="headerText3"><span>How To Get 200 For An Assignment</span></p>
	<p>To get <b>200</b> for an assignment, you will need to do the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Premium.lbi" --> <strong>Premium</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem --> part <i>instead of</i> the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Regular.lbi" --> <strong>Regular</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem --> part. For assignments that do not have an a <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Premium.lbi" --> <strong>Premium</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem --> part, just do the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Regular.lbi" --> <strong>Regular</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem --> part &ndash; there is no way to get  over <strong>100 </strong>for an assignment that has no <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Premium.lbi" --> <strong>Premium</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem --> part. <br />
		<br />
  Standards for successful completion of a <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Premium.lbi" --> <strong>Premium</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem --> part are the same as the standards for success in the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Regular.lbi" --> <strong>Regular</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem --> part, listed above.</p>
	<p class="headerText2"><span>Final Grade</span></p>
	<p>Your final grade will be a function of the quality of your work on the assignments and your scores on the quizzes. To get an <strong>A</strong>, you will need to do <em>all</em> of the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Premium.lbi" --> <strong>Premium</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem --> assignments and score well on the quizzes. To get a <strong>B</strong>, you will need to do all of the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Regular.lbi" --> <strong>Regular</strong><!-- #EndLibraryItem --> assignments and score well on the quizzes.</p>
	<p class="headerText">Netiquette</p>
	<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to say about &ldquo;net etiquette,&rdquo; but short summary is sufficient: I expect us to treat each other and this course with consideration and respect.</p>
	<p>I want this to be a safe learning environment. <em>There are no dumb questions</em>. What&rsquo;s dumb is to not ask when you don&rsquo;t understand something. By not asking, you&rsquo;re just wasting your tuition money and time.</p>
	<p>The path to the top of the Mountain of Knowledge necessarily passes through the Valley of Stupidity. If you&rsquo;re not willing to feel dumb on the way, you&rsquo;re not going to learn much Computer Science. But in this class, we&rsquo;re not going to do anything to make it worse than it has to be. There&rsquo;s going to be plenty of opportunity to feel dumb, even if we&rsquo;re nice to each other. </p>
	<p><span class="headerText">Academic Honesty</span>	</p>
	<p>Learning to work with computers is the mental equivalent of learning gymnastics. If you don&rsquo;t actually do the work yourself, you will not learn to do this - and the first time you actually have to accomplish something, it&rsquo;ll be obvious that you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
	<p>It&rsquo;s fine if you want to work with other students on a project, but make sure that you do the work yourself and understand what you did. Cheating and plagiarism will be dealt with as mercilessly as the college&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.pcc.edu/about/policy/student%2Drights/student-rights.pdf#academic" target="_blank">Academic Integrity Policy</a> allows.</p>
	<p><span class="headerText">Special Needs</span>  </p>
	<p>If you have a disability and need an accommodation, please make arrangements to meet with me outside of class. PCC students requesting accommodations must provide documentation of disability and work with the <a href="http://www.pcc.edu/resources/disability/" target="_blank">Office for Students with Disabilities</a> (OSD) at 503-977-4341.</p>
