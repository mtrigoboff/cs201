<p><strong>You must include a relevant subject in the "Subject:" or "RE:" section of your e-mail.</strong> The subject must include the class you are taking, your name, and the topic of your message.</p>

Your first communication assignment is to introduce yourself in the discussion topic "Introductions."</p>

<h3>Instructional Approach</h3>
<p>This course is arranged chronologically and employs a modular design. Each week, students should complete all assignments listed in that week's lesson module. These modules will appear directly on the homepage during the week they are due, and are also available by clicking "Content" on the course navigation bar.</p>
<p>Due dates for each week's assignments will be listed within the module itself, as well as in the "course calendar" which is also available on the Content or on the Schedule. Assignments within the modules may direct students to use many of the tools contained in Brightspace, including the Assignment, Discussions, and Quizzes. These tools will be accessible both from within the weekly content modules, as well as from the course navigation bar.</p>
<h3>Participation Expectations</h3>
<p>Students in this course are expected to enter the course at least 3 times a week to work on the modules, check email, and participate in discussions. Prompt participation in discussions is especially important when group work is involved since others in your group are depending on your input. Each time you log into the course be sure to check for any new announcements, email and discussion messages, and calendar postings.</p>
